# CNetworkTables

A Swift package wrapping the FRC [NetworkTables](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/75361/l/843361-what-is-networktables) library. Since Swift does not support C++ interop, only the C interface in [ntcore_c.h](https://github.com/NobodyNada/CNetworkTables/blob/master/Sources/CNetworkTables/include/ntcore_c.h) is accessible.

All code is from [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib).
